    <div class="paragraph1"><p class='p8'><a name="Fishing">Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.Fishing is a good way to spend quality time with family and friends.Get yourself a boat and just relax on the sea and catch the biggest fish you can.</p></a>
    <h5>Types Of Fishing</h5>
    <p class="p9">commercial fishing,recreational fishing,traditional fishing.</p>
    <h5>Equipment needed</h5>
    <p class='p10'>Extra lines,extra hooks,bobbers,sinkers,plastic worms,a couple of lures,needle nose pliers,small first aid kit,sun screen and a line cutter.</p></div>

    <p class='p1'><a name="Hiking">A hiking trail in Oregon
    Hiking is the preferred term, in Canada and the United States, for a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails (footpaths), in the countryside, while the word walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" is acceptable to describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling (a slightly old-fashioned term), hillwalking, and fell walking (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called tramping.It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits</p></a>

  <h5>Equipment</h5>
  <p class="p2">The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear.Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability.The Mountaineers club recommends a list of "Ten Essentials" equipment for hiking, including a compass, a trekking pole, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife.Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket.A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.

      <div class="paragraph3"><a name="Camping"><p class='p3'>Camping is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a tent. Generally participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. To be regarded as
      "camping" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities. Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons.
      Adventure camping is a form of camping by people who race (possibly adventure racing or mountain biking) during the day, and camp in a minimalist way at night. They might use the basic items of camping equipment such as a micro-camping stove, sleeping bag, and bivouac shelter.</p>
      <h5>Forms of Camping</h5>
      <p class="p4">Adventure camping,dry camping,backpacking,canoe camping,bicycle camping,car,off-road and rv camping,reenactment camping and social camping.</p>
      <h5>Types of equipment needed.</h5>

    <p class="p11">Hammer or mallet to drive tent stakes into the soil (hammer are often a claw hammer, which is also helpful for removing them)
    Sleeping bag and/or blankets for warmth,
    Sleeping pad or air mattress to be placed underneath the sleeping bag for cushioning from stones and twigs, as well as for insulation from the ground.
    Lantern or flashlight,
    Hatchet, axe or saw for cutting firewood for a campfire
    Fire starter or other ignition device for starting a campfire,
    Ropes for stringing clothes line and for securing the shelter.
    Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>

         <div class="paragraph4">
          <p class="p5"><a name="Rock Climbing">Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents are more likely to happen on the descent than the ascent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.</p>


          <h5>Equipment</h5>
          <p class="p7">Most climbers choose to wear specialized rubber climbing shoes which are often of a smaller size than their normal street shoes in order to improve sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a climbing rope. </p></a>
